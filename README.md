## Hi, Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm James. Right now I'm a student working towards a Software Engineering degree at the University of Strathclyde.

## Repositories
Most of the stuff you'll see on my page is just old uni projects that I've thrown up here for archival purposes.
I'm probably not working on any of it anymore, but feel free to poke around.
